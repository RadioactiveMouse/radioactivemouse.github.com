Octopress on the Raspberry Pi
======================

Octopress on the Raspberry Pi isn't too hard ti install but ensure you are working on the correct branch before pushing.

You'll need:

- Ruby
- Ruby-dev
- Git

Also ensure git is set up properly as the rake jobs don't error particularly well....
