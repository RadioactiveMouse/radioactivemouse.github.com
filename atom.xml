    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2>Currently</h2>

<p>My current setup is a collection of different ideas I&#8217;ve thought were a good idea at the time. My issue is that whilst they were a good fit for me then, they are less so now.  For example the Mac was bought when I spent the majority of time in my flat a alone which is no longer the case.</p>

<p>What I use and for when:</p>

<p>iPad 16GB with Prompt SSH client
Raspberry Pi 256MB model B with Edimax Wifi adapter and Debian</p>

<pre><code>Mostly used for Go hacking and Riak
</code></pre>

<p>iPad 16GB with Prompt SSH client
University Server 24 Intel Xeon cores at 2.67Ghz running CentOS</p>

<pre><code>University projects for machine learning and data mining tasks
</code></pre>

<p>2011 Mac Mini Server 2.0Ghz quad core i7 4GB RAM dual 1TB HDDs</p>

<pre><code>Word Processing and occasional light web development work
</code></pre>

<h2>The Future</h2>

<p>I am currently assessing my needs for the next machine for me. Should the status of the ARM Chrubuntu get better I would be sorely tempted by the latest Samsung Chromebook especially if the 3G modem is still operational.   This might only end up as a stop gap but I can&#8217;t rule it out.</p>

<p>For a home machine I am very interested in the status of the Steam Linux Client. There are a few instances where being able to play a game on my home rig would be good. Unfortunately my Mac was bought for CPU power and therefore only utlises the very weak Intel HD 3000. A Ubuntu machine running a decent i5 might be a consideration in the near future especially if Haswell proves to be good enough to support medium graphics settings.</p>

<p>In the longer run there is a large part of me giving serious thought to a Macbook Air if the rumours about serious gains in battery life are to be believed. Whilst generally underpowered for a lot of development,I I would find it very hard to go back to anything much heavier than an iPad  now I&#8217;ve used it for an extended period. Weight and a longer battery life makes it a hard decision to not consider the Air.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2>GoSetup</h2>

<p>After having to reinstall Go for a third time due to OS corruption I decided to create a tool that would automate the process of creating the directories and adding Go to the PATH.</p>

<p>This has the following aims:</p>

<ul>
<li>Automate directory structure creation</li>
<li>Allow structure to be namespaced in github format (github.com/RadioactiveMouse)</li>
<li>Create an alias for easy GoDir traversal (GODIR = /gocode/src/github.com/RadioactiveMouse/)</li>
<li>Append PATH with Go specific locations</li>
</ul>


<p>The idea of this is to make it almost foolproof to get go setup correctly on the Raspberry Pi.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2>Basic Tools and settings</h2>

<p>I should probably start by mentioning that I use the Pi headless, connected via the very good Edimax wifi adapter.</p>

<p>Below is a list of the various applications that I have installed via Apt:</p>

<ul>
<li>Screen (essential for any compilation as described further down the post</li>
<li>Erlang (necessary for building Riak)</li>
<li>Git (essential version control software that is also used to get Riak)</li>
<li>Mecurial (another version control tool for retrieving Go)</li>
<li>Vim (text editor with optional syntax highlighting)</li>
</ul>


<p>I also compile various tools necessary to any development. This where screen (or tmux) work really well. By utilising Screen I can run several development tasks in concert with eachother. This means I can compile both Riak and Go at the same time making it much more convenient. The: programs are as follows:</p>

<ul>
<li>Riak (cloned &amp; installed from Github repo, approx 90mins)</li>
<li>Go (programming language grabbed by mecurial and built as per http://dave.cheney.net/2012/09/25/installing-go-on-the-raspberry-pi , approx 90mins)</li>
<li>Node JS (Built from source in usual way, approx 100mins)</li>
</ul>


<p>I also create .screenrc and .vimrc files early on in order to configure the behaviour of this software.</p>

<p>Overall there aren&#8217;t too many other programs needed to get started using the Raspberry Pi as a tiny development server. My current setup is based around my use of Panic&#8217;s excellent Prompt SSH client on the iPad. I intend to use this setup up to create and run Go programs including the Riak library which is the focus of my dissertation.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>When setting up Octopress I found a lot of the setup a little awkward to get my head around. Maybe this is just a little inexperience but this [post] (http://learnaholic.me/2012/10/10/deploying-octopress-to-github-pages-and-setting-custom-subdomain-cname/) made it a lot easier to understand and came with instruction on how to setup up the CNAME record.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h1>Octopress on the Raspberry Pi</h1>

<p>Octopress on the Raspberry Pi isn&#8217;t too hard ti install but ensure you are working on the correct branch before pushing.</p>

<p>You&#8217;ll need:</p>

<ul>
<li>Ruby</li>
<li>Ruby-dev</li>
<li>Git</li>
</ul>


<p>Also ensure git is set up properly as the rake jobs don&#8217;t error particularly well&#8230;.</p>
